                <h2>Aspiring SDE & Front-End Developer</h2>
                <p>Hello, I'm Parangat Thakur, born on December 1, 2001, in Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh, India.
                    I completed high school at MCS Gaggal and senior secondary education at HAPS Hamirpur, both in
                    Himachal Pradesh. Currently pursuing a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering at Lovely
                    Professional University (LPU) in Punjab, India. As an aspiring Software Development Engineer (SDE),
                    I have a strong command of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), practicing extensively in Java.
                    Java collections have been invaluable for efficient problem-solving. I'm also skilled in the
                    Front-End Development â€” HTML, CSS, JavaScript & ReactJs. I'm proud of my feature-rich Weather
                    Website App made using ReactJs framework, showcasing my abilities. I'm eager to take on new
                    challenges and stay updated with the latest technologies in software development. Excited to
                    contribute my skills to impactful solutions as I continue my journey as a developer.</p>
